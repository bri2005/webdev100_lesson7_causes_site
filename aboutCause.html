			<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>Every year tens of millions of sharks die a slow death because of finning. Finning is the inhumane practice of hacking off the fins of the shark and throwing its still living body back into the sea. The sharks either starve to death, are eaten alive by other fish, or drown (if they are not in constant movement their gills cannot extract oxygen from the water). Shark fins are being harvested in ever greater numbers to feed the growing demand for shark fin soup, an Asian delicacy. We were founded in 2016 to stop this barbaric practice. To date we have shut down 100's of shark finning operations!<p>

			<h3>Why Donate?</h3> 
			<p>Your donations will help us continue our fight against shark finning. We will be able to hire more full time crews in addition to our volunteer crews. It will also allow us to buy more ships for our fleet. The more ships we have in the water, the better our chances of catching finners.</p>
